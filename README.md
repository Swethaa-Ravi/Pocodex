# Pocodex

This is a small game developed using Create-React-App, a React utility script that sets up the skeleton of our project such that JavaScript files are run through Babel automatically.

On each load, the Pokemon Cards are rearranged into two teams of four cards each. Based on the sum total of the base experience of each pokemon card of the team, a winner is decided.
